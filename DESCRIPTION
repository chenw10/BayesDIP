Description: Provide early termination phase II trial designs with a decreasingly informative prior (DIP) 
             or a regular Bayesian prior chosen by the user. The program can determine the minimum 
             planned sample size necessary to achieve the user-specified admissible designs. The program 
             can also perform power and expected sample size calculations for the tests in early 
             termination Phase II trials.
